# Fedora 3 to Fedora 4 Shim

The essential purpose of this tool is to allow Fedora 3 repositories to be used with the [Fedora 4 Camel Toolbox](https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo-camel-toolbox). It is _not_ meant to permit a legacy repository to be used with arbitrary scripted frameworks like Hydra or Islandora/CLAW.
